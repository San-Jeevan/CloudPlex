# CloudPlex
A virtual plex box in the cloud, connected to usenet. iOS apps to search after NZBs and download to cloud.

ERR: change usenet to .torrent

# Initial idea
Use AWS or AZURE to host personal storage.

Create worker instances with usenet clients on to fetch files from usenet, merge, transcode etc.

iOS app will give users posibility to buy subscription based on bandwidth usage.

iOS app will require user to make his own NZB search engine and connect it to the app to get the search working.

# Estimated start of this project: feburary 2017
